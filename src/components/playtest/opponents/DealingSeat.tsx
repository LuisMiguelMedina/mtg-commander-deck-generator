/**
 * The seat a deck gets the instant you pick it, before its cards exist.
 *
 * Seating a bot is a Scryfall round trip for a hundred names, and until this
 * existed the whole trip happened behind a spinner on a tile in a dialog you
 * were probably about to close — you clicked a deck, the table did nothing,
 * and some time later a fully-formed opponent blinked into being. So the
 * playmat arrives on the click and the deck fills it in afterwards.
 *
 * Deliberately the same chrome as a real seat — same width, same border, same
 * colour-identity art — because it is not a spinner standing in for a seat, it
 * IS the seat, waiting for its cards. When the opponent lands it takes this
 * one's place in the row and the swap reads as the deck arriving rather than
 * as one panel replacing another.
