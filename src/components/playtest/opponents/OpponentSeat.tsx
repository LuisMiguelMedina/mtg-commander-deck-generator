/**
 * One opponent, seated across the table. Everything they own is always on
 * screen — creatures, other permanents, lands, hand and zones. A bot playing a
 * land or a mana rock is still a bot doing something, and a collapsed seat
 * that hid it made their turns read as nothing happening.
 *
 * The cost is vertical space, so the layout is dense rather than partial:
 * lands get a line of their own that never wraps — they shrink to fit it
 * instead — and card sizes step down by row so the creature row, the one you
 * actually scan, stays the biggest thing here.
 *
 * The seat is an overlay, never a reflow: battlefield cards are stored at
 * absolute x/y and the canvas is overflow-hidden, so a canvas that shortened
 * to make room would clip the cards near the top and silently invalidate the
 * coordinates the player built their board around.

          as nothing happening.

          With an explicit height the board takes whatever is left over and
          scrolls inside it. Without one the seat is as tall as its board wants
          to be, so a developed board reads at a glance instead of hiding its
          back rows behind a scrollbar.

          The vh ceiling is a backstop for a pathological board — a goblin deck
          can hold sixty-eight permanents — not a working limit. It used to be
          38vh, which ordinary boards hit routinely. Three things make the room
          affordable: identical cards pile into one counted card, BOARD_ZOOM
          draws the wrapping rows smaller, and `setSeatBandHeight` walks any of
          the player's own cards that the grown band covers down to a free slot
          — so growing downwards no longer buries their battlefield.

          Either way the header, lands, zones and combat strip stay pinned —
          shortening a seat should cost you the least useful rows, not the life
          total or the fight. */}

          drawn deliberately OUTSIDE their card's box: the ×N pile badge at the
          top left, the destroy skull at the top right, and the edited/pumped
          P/T at the bottom right. All three hang 4px past the corner, so on the
          first row, the last card of a row, and the last row they were being
          sliced in half.

          Clipping happens at the padding box, so the fix is room INSIDE it: 6px
          of padding gives the overhang somewhere to live. The matching negative
          margins put the cards themselves back exactly where they were, which
          matters because the land row below has no padding and the two rows
          have to start on the same left edge. */}
