  // mostly format goodstuff, so any deck in the right colors overlaps ALL of its commander's theme
  // pages heavily and the signal stops discriminating. EDHREC's per-card synergy separates the two
  // cases — a card's rate in these decks minus its rate everywhere — and it was already summed here
  // and never used.
  //
  // Credit is graded, not gated. A binary `synergy > 0` test was measured to pass 79% of a page's
  // cards, so it barely discounted anything and a commander's headline themes went on scoring off
  // the deck's staples. `cardOverlap` stays a true count for display; only the score consumes the
  // graded credit.
  // Synergy is a difference of rates, so its noise scales with the page's denominator exactly as
  // inclusion's does — and unshrunk it made the grading REWARD thin pages. Measured on Nath of the
  // Gilt-Leaf, median synergy against deck count: birthing-pod 8 decks -> 0.124, stax 38 -> 0.097,
  // discard 229 -> 0.060, base page 1432 -> 0.054. Perfectly monotonic, because on eight decks every
  // card is over-represented by construction. The graded credit that followed was 71% / 60% / 50% /
  // 50%, so an 8-deck page outscored the deck's real archetype on small-sample noise alone.
  //
  // 0 means "not reported" rather than "no decks": the archetype tag-page fallback synthesizes a
  // page without a count, and those pool thousands of decks. Treat unknown as full confidence.
