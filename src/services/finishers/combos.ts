/**
 * Infinite combos as FUEL, not as a separate list bolted on the side.
 *
 * A combo's `results` are a structured vocabulary, and most of them don't win on their own — they
 * make a finisher the deck already has lethal. Measured over the 11,667-combo golgari closure:
 *
 *   Infinite death triggers        6547   → makes Blood Artist / Zulaport lethal
 *   Infinite creature sacrifice    6288   → same
 *   Infinite * mana               ~4500   → every drain-x and burn-x gets X = infinity
 *   Infinite creature tokens      ~1600   → every alpha-strike gets unbounded bodies
 *   Infinite lifeloss / damage    ~2000   → wins outright
 *
 * "Infinite death triggers" being the single most common result is the point: the kill math
 * already had a `deaths` scaling variable that always returned null because nothing could supply
 * a value. This is that value.
 *
 * Only COMPLETE combos count. A near-miss (missing a card) is a deckbuilding note, not a kill.
