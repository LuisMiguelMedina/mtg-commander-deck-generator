/**
 * A bot's open attack, read off the live board rather than off the snapshot it
 * was declared from.
 *
 * `CombatState` is a photograph taken when the bot declared. Two things then go
 * wrong if you trust it:
 *
 *  - You kill one of the attackers mid-combat. It is gone from the bot's board
 *    but still in the photograph, so it dealt its damage anyway.
 *  - Its stats change. An anthem dies, a counter comes off, and the numbers in
 *    the photograph are no longer what is standing there.
 *
 * And because the preview number and the resolution used to be computed two
 * different ways, the button could lie outright: it summed unblocked power,
 * while `resolveDamage` also adds trample overflow. Chumping a 10/10 trampler
 * read "Resolve" and then took nine off you.
 *
 * One function, used by both, so they cannot disagree.
