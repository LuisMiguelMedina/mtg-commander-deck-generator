/**
 * What happens when a bot's creatures die.
 *
 * Kept out of both the store and the engine because deaths happen in both, and
 * they have to agree: a Midnight Reaper draws whether its friend died blocking
 * your alpha strike or died attacking another bot. The store owns combat
 * deaths, the engine owns sacrifices, and neither should own this.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. It resolves only the effects that can be applied to the
 * bot's own zones plus a life total — draw, mill, reanimate, regrow, and a
 * drain. Anything needing a target on the player's board is left to the normal
 * cast path, because a death trigger fires outside the frame loop and has
 * nowhere to put an AppliedEffect.
