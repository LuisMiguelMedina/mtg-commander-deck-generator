/**
 * What a bot can pay for, and which permanents it taps to do it.
 *
 * This used to be a single number — "lands on the battlefield" — with colours
 * ignored on the grounds that colour correctness turns a goldfish into a rules
 * engine. It does not: a bot's mana base is a handful of permanents and a spell
 * has a handful of pips, so a greedy assignment settles it. The number-only
 * version was visible at the table, because the tap animation showed a Dimir
 * bot turning two Islands sideways to cast a black spell.
 *
 * What is still approximate, deliberately:
 *  - A source produces `amount` mana of ANY colour it can make, so "{T}: Add
 *    {U}{B}" reads as two mana that are each U or B rather than one of each.
 *  - Activated, cycling and recursion costs in the registry are plain numbers,
 *    so those are paid as generic. Only cards cast from hand or the command
 *    zone — which have a real `mana_cost` — are colour-checked.
 *  - A land that makes no mana at all still taps for one colourless, which is
 *    what it did before and keeps a Maze of Ith from stranding the bot.
