/**
 * Combat decisions, in both directions.
 *
 * Every case here is something a real game showed going wrong. The blocking
 * ones especially: the original single pass took a block only when the blocker
 * killed the attacker AND survived it, so an untapped deathtouch flier watched
 * a 6/6 walk past it and a 2/5 took three to the face rather than blocking a
 * 3/3 it comfortably lived through.
 *
 * Thresholds are asserted on purpose — they are the behaviour, and moving one
 * should be a change somebody meant to make.
