   * Three distinct causes, all found by measuring rather than guessing:
   *  - Keyword ACTIONS never reach `card.keywords` (only 51 of 79 do), so Discard, Sacrifice, Exile
   *    and Voting matched zero cards — a textbook Nath discard deck could not detect Discard.
   *  - TOKEN-only types have no cards to match. Nothing has "Servo" or "Blood" on its type line;
   *    cards merely create those tokens.
   *  - Some keywords are real but too rare in the playable pool (Phasing, Dredge) to seed a
   *    definition, since lift needs a minimum number of carriers.
   *
   * Recorded here because only the build script sees enough cards to know. Absent on an ungenerated
   * table, in which case nothing is downgraded and behaviour is unchanged.
