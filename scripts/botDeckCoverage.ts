/**
 * How much of each bot deck the bot actually understands.
 *
 * Run: `npm run bot:coverage`. Offline — it reads the committed fixture, so run
 * `npm run build:bot-fixture` first if a decklist changed.
 *
 * ## What this is for
 *
 * The whole bet of the playtest opponents is that we teach the bot these
 * specific decks rather than building a Magic engine. That only works if we can
 * answer "does this bot understand its own deck yet?" — otherwise a deck ships
 * with eight cards that quietly do nothing and it plays like a worse deck for
 * reasons nobody can see. This is the per-deck shipping gate.
 *
 * A card counts as understood when it needs no guidance or already has some:
 *
 *   land     — the engine plays these itself
 *   mana     — a "{T}: Add …" source, read generically by `manaFrom`
 *   scripted — has an entry in one of the registries in effects.ts
 *   vanilla  — no rules text beyond keywords the combat module already reads
 *   GAP      — has text that matters and nothing to act on it
 *
 * The GAP list is the authoring queue, in the order it should be worked.
